# DME V2 — Retention Field

## 1. Purpose

  The Retention Field defines how DME V2 governs persistence, decay, archive, quarantine, echo eligibility, and lawful re-entry of traces, records, projections, proofs, failures, authority decisions, and causal signatures.

  It answers:

    > What may persist, for how long, under what authority ceiling, with what decay behavior, and under what conditions may it re-enter future processing?

  The Retention Field governs:

    - trace persistence
    - causal signature lifecycle
    - proof object persistence
    - proof failure persistence
    - projection receipt persistence
    - runtime trace decay
    - relation/topology candidate retention
    - decision topology retention
    - governance decision retention
    - admissibility profile retention
    - agent authority record retention
    - quarantine retention
    - archive posture
    - echo eligibility
    - re-entry conditions

  The Retention Field does not define:

    - identity
    - proof
    - source truth
    - runtime authority
    - governance consequence
    - projection access
    - agent sovereignty
    - semantic memory
    - canon

  Retention preserves governed trace.

  It does not make the retained trace true.

  ---

## 2. Placement

  Runtime placement:

    Authority / Governance
      → Projection / Retention / Agency Feedback
      → Retention Field
      → Ledger Hypergraph / Runtime Manifold / Projection Field / Agency Field
      → Future Recursion

  Operationally:

    Ledger records continuity.
    Projection exposes bounded view.
    Retention governs persistence and re-entry.
    Echo reintroduces retained trace under admissibility.
    Runtime may use retained support.
    Proof tests survival.
    Governance authorizes consequence.

  The Retention Field sits between ledgered history and future runtime recursion.

  It is the persistence and re-entry governance layer of DME V2.

## 3. Core Thesis

  Retention is not memory as identity.

  Retention is governed persistence of trace under declared lifecycle conditions.

  A retained structure may support future reconstruction, replay, audit, projection, proof, governance, or runtime echo.

  But retention alone cannot prove identity, authorize consequence, expand agency, or mutate system behavior.

  Final compression:

    trace
      → retention decision
      → lifecycle posture
      → decay / archive / quarantine / echo eligibility
      → possible re-entry
      → admissibility evaluation
      → runtime/proof/projection/governance route

  Core law:

    Retention preserves trace.
    Echo reintroduces trace.
    Admissibility permits re-entry.
    Proof tests survival.
    Governance authorizes consequence.

## 4. Authority Ceiling

  The maximum authority of the Retention Field is:

    retention posture

  The Retention Field may emit:

    RetentionCandidate
    RetentionDecision
    RetentionRecord
    RetentionReceipt
    RetentionFailure
    CausalSignatureRetention
    EchoEligibilityRecord
    DecaySchedule
    ArchiveRecord
    QuarantineRetentionRecord
    ReEntryHandle
    SupersessionRecord
    ExpiryRecord

  The Retention Field may not emit:

    identity
    proof object
    governance decision
    authority vector update
    projection permission
    agent authority
    mutation authority
    source truth
    ledger truth
    semantic memory
    canon

## 5. Non-Claims

  The Retention Field does not claim:

    retention = identity
    retention = proof
    retention = authority
    retention = source
    retention = projection
    retention = agency
    retention = semantic truth
    retention = canon
    recurrence = identity
    persistence = authority
    echo = proof
    archive = truth
    quarantine = deletion
    decay = erasure

  Every RetentionRecord must carry explicit non-claims.

## 6. Retention vs Ledger

  Ledger and Retention are coupled but distinct.

  Ledger

    Ledger records lawful continuity.

    Ledger answers:

      What happened, where did it come from, and what lawful path produced it?

    Ledger stores:

      retention records
      projection records
      proof traces
      proof objects
      proof failures
      governance decisions
      admissibility decisions
      causal signatures
      echo edges
      revocation/supersession edges

    Ledger does not decide what should persist.

  Retention

    Retention governs lifecycle posture.

    Retention answers:

      What remains eligible to persist, decay, echo, archive, quarantine, or re-enter?

    Retention may configure:

      duration
      decay behavior
      echo eligibility
      re-entry scope
      review conditions
      revocation conditions
      archive posture
      quarantine posture
      compression posture
      reconstruction support posture

  Ledger records retention.

  Retention governs persistence.

  Neither grants identity.

## 7. Retention vs Projection

  Projection exposes bounded view-space.

  Retention governs whether projection traces persist and whether they may later influence runtime, proof, governance, or agency.

  Projection may produce retention-relevant artifacts:

    ProjectionObject
    ProjectionRecord
    ProjectionReceipt
    ProjectionFailure
    AgentReadPacket
    GovernanceReviewPacket
    TrainingProjectionCandidate
    ProjectionExpiryRecord

  Retention decides:

    whether the projection record persists
    whether the receipt persists
    whether the exposed view may be echoed
    whether the consumer interaction is retained
    whether projection failure feeds governance/proof
    whether projection artifacts expire, decay, archive, or quarantine

  Core law:

    Projection exposes.
    Retention governs persistence of exposure trace.

  A projection record is not the source.

  A retained projection record is still not the source.

## 8. Retention vs Echo

  Retention and Echo are related but distinct.

  Retention

    Retention stores lifecycle posture.

    It answers:

      May this trace persist?

  Echo

    Echo reintroduces retained trace into current admissible processing.

    It answers:

      May this prior trace re-enter the present, and how?

    Echo requires:

      retained trace
      echo eligibility
      scope of re-entry
      loss/compression declaration
      temporal order preservation
      authority ceiling
      admissibility decision

  Core law:

    Retention makes echo possible.
    Echo does not make retention authoritative.

  Echo does not grant authority by recurrence alone.

## 9. Retention Field Inputs

  The Retention Field may read from:

    NativeEmission refs
    PayloadRefs
    IngestNodes
    StructuralObjects
    Charts
    StructuralSignatures
    Features
    DistinctionEvidencePackets
    DistinctionRegions
    Distinction-State refs
    FieldProfile summaries
    InterferenceTrace summaries
    RelationCandidates
    TopologyCandidates
    DecisionTopologyProjections
    DecisionNodes
    TransitionEdges
    AdmissibilityDecisions
    ProofCandidates
    ProofExecutions
    ProofTraces
    ProofObjects
    ProofFailureObjects
    GovernanceCandidates
    GovernanceDecisions
    ProjectionObjects
    ProjectionRecords
    ProjectionReceipts
    ProjectionFailures
    AgentAuthorityRecords
    CausalSignatures

  Every retained input must preserve:

    source refs
    lineage refs
    temporal frame
    authority ceiling
    uncertainty
    loss profile
    scope
    non-claims

## 10. Retention Field Outputs

The Retention Field may emit:

  RetentionCandidate
  RetentionDecision
  RetentionRecord
  RetentionReceipt
  RetentionFailure
  DecaySchedule
  EchoEligibilityRecord
  ReEntryHandle
  ArchiveRecord
  QuarantineRetentionRecord
  CausalSignatureRetention
  RetentionSupersessionRecord
  RetentionExpiryRecord
  RetentionRevocationRecord

Retention outputs are lifecycle objects.

They are not proof, authority, identity, or source.

11. Retention Field Axes

Every retention decision is evaluated across retention axes:

R_ret(x) = [
  lineage_validity,
  temporal_validity,
  authority_ceiling,
  persistence_reason,
  decay_behavior,
  echo_eligibility,
  re_entry_scope,
  uncertainty_posture,
  loss_or_compression,
  reconstruction_support,
  quarantine_risk,
  privacy_or_exposure_risk,
  review_or_revocation_conditions
]

These axes define persistence geometry.

They do not define identity.

12. Axis 1 — Lineage Validity

Lineage validity determines whether the trace can lawfully persist.

Checks:

source refs valid
parent refs valid
transform refs declared
proof refs declared where proof support is invoked
governance refs declared where authority support is invoked
projection refs declared where exposure trace is retained
causal signature refs declared where causal support is retained

Failure modes:

orphan retention
hidden transform
missing proof ref
unsupported authority reference
projection retained as source
untraceable echo candidate

Possible outputs:

retain
retain_limited
route_to_reconstruction
quarantine
defer
reject_retention
13. Axis 2 — Temporal Validity

Temporal validity determines whether persistence and re-entry preserve causal order.

Retention must distinguish:

ledger sequence time
source-local time
runtime cycle time
projection exposure time
governance effective time
retention lifecycle time
external / OS clock time

Failure modes:

stale trace reused as current state
future information leak
recurrence without trace
projection exposure time substituted for source time
governance expiry ignored
retention expiry ignored
echo source does not precede echo use

Core law:

Retention preserves lifecycle time.
Echo must preserve causal order.
14. Axis 3 — Authority Ceiling

Every retention object must declare its maximum claim.

Common retention authority ceilings:

ephemeral_trace
diagnostic_trace
runtime_support
projection_record
proof_evidence
proof_supported_retention
governance_record
quarantine_retention
archive_record
reconstruction_support
agent_authority_record
causal_evidence

Retention authority does not imply epistemic authority.

Retention authority does not imply operational authority.

Retention authority does not imply mutation authority.

Retention authority does not imply agent authority.

Core law:

Retained means available under lifecycle posture.
Retained does not mean authorized for consequence.
15. Axis 4 — Persistence Reason

Retention must declare why a trace persists.

Valid persistence reasons may include:

audit_required
lineage_required
proof_support
proof_failure_evidence
governance_record
projection_accountability
agent_action_accountability
reconstruction_support
recurrence_support
diagnostic_interest
quarantine_required
archive_required
legal_or_policy_hold
user_requested
system_integrity
training_candidate_hold

No retention without reason.

Retention reason bounds future use.

16. Axis 5 — Decay Behavior

Decay behavior determines how retained trace weakens, compresses, expires, or loses echo eligibility over time.

Decay behavior may include:

none
time_decay
use_decay
uncertainty_decay
authority_decay
projection_expiry_decay
quarantine_decay
compression_decay
review_decay
manual_review_required

Decay may affect:

salience
echo eligibility
projection eligibility
reconstruction confidence
proof support weight
agent accessibility
governance review priority

Decay is not deletion.

Decay must preserve audit trace where consequential.

17. Axis 6 — Echo Eligibility

  Echo eligibility determines whether retained trace may re-enter current processing.

  Echo eligibility must declare:

  eligible / ineligible / restricted
  earliest echo time
  latest echo time
  permitted modes
  required admissibility profile
  allowed re-entry scope
  loss/compression
  authority ceiling
  proof/governance requirements
  revocation conditions

  Echo eligibility states:

  not_echoable
  echoable_as_index
  echoable_as_support
  echoable_as_diagnostic
  echoable_as_runtime_bias
  echoable_as_proof_support
  echoable_as_governance_context
  echoable_only_under_quarantine

  Echo eligibility is not echo execution.

  Actual echo requires an admissibility decision.

## Retention Support Vector

  A Retention Support Vector is the bounded runtime-facing expression of retained trace support.

  It translates Retention Field lifecycle posture into runtime weighting support without granting identity, proof, authority, or transition permission.

  RSV(x) = [
    retention_strength,
    echo_eligibility_weight,
    decay_factor,
    reconstruction_support_weight,
    causal_trace_density
  ]

  Derived only from:

  RetentionRecord
  EchoEligibilityRecord
  DecaySchedule
  CausalSignatureRetention
  ReEntryHandle

  Allowed use:

  attention initialization
  salience weighting
  decay modulation
  recurrence_flow shaping
  retention_pressure estimation
  reconstruction support routing

  Forbidden use:

  bypass admissibility
  grant transition permission
  grant relation stability
  elevate topology candidate into identity
  contribute to proof directly
  influence governance outcome directly
  grant agent authority

  Core law:

  Retention may influence availability and weighting.
  Retention may not decide outcome, proof, authority, or consequence.

  Non-claims:

  retention_support_is_not_identity
  retention_support_is_not_proof
  retention_support_is_not_authority
  causal_trace_density_is_not_explanation
  echo_eligibility_is_not_runtime_activation

  Re-entry route:

  RetentionRecord
  → EchoEligibilityRecord
  → ReEntryHandle
  → AdmissibilityDecision
  → Runtime weighting / support

  Forbidden route:

  RetentionRecord
  → Runtime activation

18. Axis 7 — Re-Entry Scope

  Re-entry scope determines where retained trace may influence future processing.

  Possible scopes:

  index_only
  projection_only
  diagnostic_only
  runtime_support
  proof_support
  reconstruction_support
  governance_context
  agent_context
  training_candidate_context
  quarantine_only

  Re-entry must declare:

  what re-enters
  where it re-enters
  under what admissibility mode
  what authority ceiling it carries
  what loss/compression applies
  what cannot be claimed

  Core law:

  No trace may re-enter globally by default.
19. Axis 8 — Uncertainty Posture

Retention must preserve uncertainty.

Uncertainty may include:

source uncertainty
transform uncertainty
cross-basis disagreement
missing axes
runtime instability
proof uncertainty
projection uncertainty
governance uncertainty
retention uncertainty
echo uncertainty

Retention may not convert unresolved uncertainty into stable memory.

High uncertainty may route retention to:

diagnostic_retention
short_retention
quarantine_retention
proof_required_before_echo
review_required_before_echo

Core law:

Uncertainty persists with the trace it qualifies.
20. Axis 9 — Loss or Compression

Retention may store full refs, bounded summaries, causal signatures, or compressed support handles.

Every retained compression must declare:

preserved axes
omitted axes
compression method
loss profile
reconstruction bounds
uncertainty
authority ceiling

Allowed retention forms:

full_ref_retention
bounded_snapshot_retention
causal_signature_retention
summary_retention
index_handle_retention
projection_receipt_retention
failure_surface_retention
archive_bundle_retention

Core law:

No free compression in retention.
21. Axis 10 — Reconstruction Support

Some retained traces may support reconstruction.

Reconstruction support must declare:

source refs
lineage refs
payload refs where available
transform refs
preserved axes
omitted axes
proof refs if applicable
loss profile
reconstruction bounds
recovery confidence
failure modes

Reconstruction support is not reconstruction proof.

Reconstruction proof belongs to Proof Execution.

22. Axis 11 — Quarantine Risk

Retention may preserve unsafe, unstable, contaminated, or authority-risky structures under quarantine.

Quarantine retention may apply when:

proof failed but evidence is useful
projection overclaimed
lineage is incomplete
semantic contamination suspected
authority leakage detected
agent overreach occurred
training contamination risk exists
unstable runtime structure is informative
governance requires preservation without consequence

Quarantine retention blocks:

runtime influence
broad projection
training emission
agent access
authority escalation
mutation

unless governance explicitly permits a narrower route.

Quarantine is not deletion.

Quarantine is retained trace with blocked consequence.

23. Axis 12 — Privacy or Exposure Risk

Retention must account for exposure risk.

Risk sources may include:

projection audience
agent access
external tool access
training candidate status
sensitive source refs
raw payload refs
governance review contents
user-requested privacy posture
expired exposure authority
revoked projection scope

Possible outcomes:

retain_private
retain_redacted
retain_internal_only
retain_index_only
retain_quarantined
expire_projection_trace
reject_retention
require_governance_review
24. Axis 13 — Review or Revocation Conditions

Every non-ephemeral retention posture must declare review or revocation conditions.

Review/revocation triggers may include:

expiry reached
proof contradicted
governance revoked
authority scope changed
projection expired
agent authority expired
uncertainty increased
lineage broken
source ref unavailable
reconstruction failed
retention risk increased
user request
policy change
archive threshold reached

Retention is dynamic.

Retained does not mean permanent.

25. Retention Modes

Retention modes define lifecycle posture.

Modes are not authority states.

They are persistence regimes.

Authority ceiling:

training_candidate_hold

Training-set emission requires T5 governance authority.

26. Retention Candidate

A RetentionCandidate is any trace or object proposed for lifecycle governance.

Canonical shape:

{
  "retention_candidate_id": "...",
  "candidate_type": "trace | proof | failure | projection | governance | admissibility | relation | topology | decision_topology | agent_action | causal_signature | reconstruction_support | archive | quarantine | training_candidate",
  "source_refs": [],
  "lineage_refs": [],

  "non_claims": [
    "retention_candidate_is_not_retained",
    "retention_candidate_is_not_identity",
    "retention_candidate_is_not_authority"
  ]
}

A RetentionCandidate is not retained yet.

It is a lifecycle proposal.

27. Retention Decision

A RetentionDecision determines whether and how a trace persists.

Canonical shape:

{
  "retention_decision_id": "...",
  "retention_candidate_ref": "...",
  "axis_results": {
    "lineage_validity": {},

  ]
}
28. Retention Record

A RetentionRecord is the ledgerable lifecycle posture of a retained trace.

Canonical shape:

{
  "retention_record_id": "...",
  "retention_candidate_ref": "...",
  "retention_decision_ref": "...",
  "retained_refs": [],
  "causal_signature_refs": [],
  "retention_mode": "...",

  },
  "uncertainty": {},

  "reconstruction_bounds": {},
  "review_or_revocation_conditions": [],
  "authority": {
    "ceiling": "retention_posture",
    "status": "retained"
  },
  "non_claims": [
    "retention_record_is_not_identity",
    "retention_record_is_not_proof",
    "retention_record_is_not_authority",
    "retained_trace_is_not_source"
  ]
}
29. Retention Receipt

Every consequential retention action emits a receipt.

Canonical shape:

{
  "retention_receipt_id": "...",
  "retention_record_ref": "...",
  "retention_decision_ref": "...",
  "operator_path": [
    "Select",
    "Record",
    "Commit"
  ],
  "retained_refs": [],
  "retention_time": {
    "retention_started_at": "...",
    "retention_expires_at": null,
    "review_after": null,
    "archived_at": null,
    "quarantine_until": null,
    "reentered_at": null
  },
  "authority": {
    "ceiling": "retention_receipt"
  },
  "non_claims": [
    "receipt_is_not_identity",
    "receipt_is_not_proof",
    "receipt_is_not_authority"
  ]
}

A receipt records that retention posture was applied.

It does not prove the retained trace.

30. Echo Eligibility Record

EchoEligibilityRecord declares whether retained trace may re-enter.

Canonical shape:

{
  "echo_eligibility_id": "...",
  "retention_record_ref": "...",
  "retained_trace_ref": "...",
  "eligibility_status": "ineligible | eligible | restricted | expired | revoked | quarantine_only",
  "allowed_echo_modes": [],
  "eligible_from": null,
  "expires_at": null,
  "required_admissibility_profile_ref": null,
  "re_entry_scope": {},
  "loss_or_compression": {},
  "authority": {
    "ceiling": "echo_eligibility"
  },
  "non_claims": [
    "echo_eligibility_is_not_echo",
    "echo_is_not_proof",
    "echo_is_not_authority"
  ]
}
31. Re-Entry Handle

A ReEntryHandle is a bounded handle allowing retained trace to be proposed for future processing.

Canonical shape:

{
  "re_entry_handle_id": "...",
  "retention_record_ref": "...",
  "echo_eligibility_ref": "...",
  "trace_source_ref": "...",
  "proposed_re_entry_scope": {},
  "required_admissibility_mode": "...",
  "loss_or_compression": {},
  "temporal_order": {},
  "authority": {
    "ceiling": "re_entry_candidate"
  },
  "non_claims": [
    "re_entry_handle_is_not_admissibility",
    "re_entry_handle_is_not_runtime_activation",
    "re_entry_handle_is_not_authority"
  ]
}

A ReEntryHandle is not activation.

Admissibility must still evaluate re-entry.

32. Retention Failure

Retention failure must remain legible.

Failure outcomes include:

reject_retention
defer_retention
quarantine_retention
expire_trace
revoke_echo
route_to_reconstruction
route_to_governance
route_to_projection_review

Canonical shape:

{
  "retention_failure_id": "...",
  "retention_candidate_ref": "...",
  "failure_type": "lineage_missing | temporal_invalid | authority_exceeded | uncertainty_too_high | loss_undeclared | privacy_risk | projection_boundary_violation | stale_authority | echo_invalid | governance_required",
  "failed_axes": [],
  "available_low_authority_routes": [],
  "required_next_step": "...",
  "uncertainty": {},
  "authority": {
    "ceiling": "retention_failure_evidence"
  },
  "non_claims": [
    "retention_failure_is_not_deletion",
    "retention_failure_is_structural_evidence"
  ]
}

Failure is retained as structural evidence unless governance requires otherwise.

33. Retention Field Process
Step 1 — Receive Retention Candidate

Candidate may originate from:

runtime trace
projection receipt
proof trace
proof object
proof failure
governance decision
admissibility decision
relation/topology candidate
decision topology map
agent action
causal signature
reconstruction support
quarantine route
Step 2 — Bind Retention Scope

Declare:

retained refs
persistence reason
requested mode
requested duration
requested echo eligibility
re-entry scope
authority ceiling
uncertainty
loss/compression
review/revocation conditions

No scope, no retention.

Step 3 — Evaluate Retention Axes

Evaluate:

lineage validity
temporal validity
authority ceiling
persistence reason
decay behavior
echo eligibility
re-entry scope
uncertainty posture
loss/compression
reconstruction support
quarantine risk
privacy/exposure risk
review/revocation conditions
Step 4 — Emit Retention Decision

Decision may:

retain
retain limited
decay
archive
quarantine
expire
revoke
supersede
defer
reject
Step 5 — Construct Retention Record

Use T2 composition:

Retention = Select + Record + Commit

If retention includes compression:

RetentionCompression = Select + Transform + Project + Record

If retention includes re-entry support:

EchoPreparation = Record + optional Project(index/support handle)
Step 6 — Record Retention Receipt

Record:

what persisted
why
under what scope
with what decay
with what echo eligibility
with what authority ceiling
with what lifecycle time
Step 7 — Monitor Lifecycle

Monitor:

expiry
decay
review window
revocation conditions
governance changes
proof contradictions
projection expiry
agent authority expiry
quarantine state
archive transition
Step 8 — Evaluate Re-Entry

If retained trace requests re-entry:

RetentionRecord
→ EchoEligibilityRecord
→ ReEntryHandle
→ AdmissibilityDecision
→ Echo
→ Runtime / Proof / Projection / Governance route

No re-entry without admissibility.

34. Relationship to T0 — Primitive Field Theory

T0 defines recursion as feedback over structure across time, scale, or representation.

Retention Field provides the trace substrate required for lawful recursion.

Retention binds:

memory / trace
locality
uncertainty
attention influence
authority ceiling
re-entry scope

Core law:

No recursion without retained or reconstructable trace.
35. Relationship to T1 — Conservation Invariants

Retention Field must preserve T1 invariants, especially:

provenance conservation
temporal order conservation
uncertainty conservation
no free compression
capacity conservation
recursion trace conservation
authority boundary conservation
projection boundary conservation
failure legibility conservation

Retention is the primary implementation surface for recursion trace conservation.

A recursive claim is invalid without retained or reconstructable trace.

36. Relationship to T2 — Phase Operators

Retention Field uses T2 operators.

Primary compositions:

Retention = Select + Record + Commit
Decay = Release + Record
Archive = Select + Project + Record + Commit
QuarantineRetention = Select + Record + Commit + Release(runtime influence)
EchoPreparation = Record + optional Project(index/support handle)
EchoExecution = Echo + Select + Project/Transform + Record
RetentionCompression = Select + Transform + Project + Record
RetentionRevocation = Release + Record

Retention may not smuggle proof or authority.

Commit in Retention means durable lifecycle posture, not identity commitment.

37. Relationship to T3 — Observables / Detectors / Stabilizers

T3 may produce retention-relevant observables:

recurrence_flow
retention_pressure
persistence_stiffness
proof_depth
failure_surface
repair_path
authority_conflict
projection_overclaim_risk
quarantine_rate
revocation_rate

T3 detects retention pressure.

Retention Field governs lifecycle posture.

Detection does not authorize persistence by itself.

38. Relationship to Runtime Manifold

Runtime Manifold may generate traces eligible for retention:

Distinction-State refs
FieldProfile summaries
InterferenceTrace summaries
RelationCandidates
TopologyCandidates
decay/release records
support handles
proof candidates

Runtime retention constraints:

active state is not identity
salience is not retention authority
recurrence is not identity
retention pressure is not retention decision
runtime persistence is not ledger commitment

Runtime may propose retention.

Retention Field decides lifecycle posture.

Governance may constrain retention authority.

39. Relationship to Admissibility Field

Admissibility governs whether retained trace may re-enter current processing.

Retention governs whether trace may persist and become eligible for echo.

Re-entry path:

RetainedTrace
→ EchoEligibilityRecord
→ ReEntryHandle
→ AdmissibilityDecision
→ Echo
→ Runtime / Proof / Projection / Governance route

Admissibility checks:

locality validity
lineage validity
uncertainty bound
budget/cost bound
salience threshold
distinguishability support
constraint compatibility
temporal validity
projection boundary
proof precondition

Retention cannot bypass admissibility.

40. Relationship to Decision Topology Mapping

Decision topology may emit retention candidates:

DecisionTopologyProjection
DecisionNode
TransitionEdge
realized trajectory
rejected branch
counterfactual branch
failure surface
repair path
drift region
convergence region
behavioral attractor
mutation candidate

Retention must preserve failures, rejected branches, and counterfactuals where needed for behavioral audit.

Core law:

No branch collapse through retention.

A behavioral attractor may increase retention pressure.

It does not authorize mutation.

41. Relationship to Proof Execution

Proof Execution emits retention-critical objects:

ProofExecution receipt
ProofTrace
ProofObject
ProofFailureObject
overchallenge result
recovery path
request_more_evidence route
quarantine route

Retention may preserve proof material for:

future proof comparison
reconstruction challenge
reduction proof support
governance review
audit
failure surface mapping

Proof-supported retention is not governance authorization.

Proof failure should remain retained as structural evidence unless governance policy says otherwise.

42. Relationship to Authority / Governance

Governance controls retention authority.

T5 may authorize, limit, revoke, quarantine, expire, or archive retention.

Retention authority is one authority-vector dimension.

Governance may configure:

retention duration
archive status
decay behavior
echo eligibility
quarantine status
training candidate hold
agent context retention
retention revocation
retention review windows

Core law:

Retention may persist only inside authority scope.
Echo may influence only inside admissibility scope.
Consequence requires governance.
43. Relationship to Projection Field

Projection Field emits projection records, receipts, failures, exposure histories, and agent read packets.

Retention Field governs:

whether projection traces persist
whether projection receipts are archived
whether projection failures feed governance
whether agent read packets persist
whether stale projections are retained as expired
whether exposed views may later echo
whether training projection candidates remain held

Projection retention constraints:

retained projection is not source
projection receipt is not proof
projection failure is structural evidence
stale projection must not re-enter as current state
training projection candidate requires governance before emission
44. Relationship to Agency Field

Agents produce retention-relevant traces:

read packets
query requests
projection requests
simulation requests
proposals
proof requests
governance requests
tool actions
failures
scope violations

Retention supports:

agent accountability
replay of agent action
scope violation detection
proposal lineage
authority revocation
audit

Retention may not grant agent rights.

Agent authority must remain projection-bound, admissibility-bound, and governance-bound.

45. Retention Lifecycle

Retention lifecycle states:

candidate
→ evaluated
→ retained / limited / rejected / deferred
→ active_retention
→ decaying
→ echo_eligible / echo_restricted / echo_expired
→ archived / quarantined / expired / revoked / superseded
→ re_entry_requested
→ admissibility_evaluated
→ echoed / denied / deferred / quarantined

Lifecycle transitions must be recorded where consequential.

No lifecycle state implies identity.

46. Retention Boundary Laws
Law 1 — Retention Is Not Identity

A retained trace is not an identity claim.

Law 2 — Retention Is Not Proof

A retained proof trace is evidence, not proof unless represented as a ProofObject under T4.

Law 3 — Retention Is Not Authority

Persistence does not grant consequence.

Law 4 — Recurrence Is Not Identity

Repeated trace may increase retention pressure, but recurrence alone does not prove identity.

Law 5 — Echo Is Not Proof

Re-entry of prior trace does not validate the trace.

Law 6 — Echo Requires Admissibility

No retained trace may re-enter runtime, proof, projection, governance, or agency without admissibility.

Law 7 — No Silent Decay

Decay must declare what weakens, expires, compresses, or loses eligibility.

Law 8 — No Silent Archive

Archive must declare access, recovery, and echo constraints.

Law 9 — No Quarantine Deletion

Quarantine preserves structure while blocking consequence.

Law 10 — No Branch Collapse

Retention may not erase rejected, failed, or counterfactual branches when they are required for behavioral audit.

Law 11 — No Projection-as-Source Retention

Retained projection records remain projection records.

They do not become source records.

Law 12 — No Global Re-Entry

Retained traces may re-enter only under declared scope.

47. Failure Modes
Retention Inflation

Retained trace treated as identity, proof, or authority.

Recurrence Inflation

Repeated trace treated as proof.

Echo Inflation

Echoed trace treated as current source truth.

Hidden Decay

Trace weakens or expires without declared lifecycle rule.

Hidden Compression

Retained structure compressed without loss declaration.

Archive Inflation

Archived trace treated as authoritative due to age or persistence.

Quarantine Leakage

Quarantined trace influences runtime, projection, agent, or training paths outside allowed scope.

Stale Authority Retention

Expired or revoked authority retained as active.

Stale Projection Re-Entry

Expired projection reused as current state.

Branch Collapse

Rejected, failed, or counterfactual branches omitted from retained decision topology.

Agent Trace Erasure

Agent actions, tool calls, or proposals omitted from retention when accountability requires them.

Failure Erasure

Proof failures, projection failures, runtime failures, or governance failures deleted instead of retained as structural evidence.

Training Contamination

Training candidate retained or emitted without proof, governance, omitted branch declaration, or failure preservation.

50. Final Compression

The Retention Field is the governed persistence and re-entry layer of DME V2.

It decides what may remain available, decay, archive, quarantine, or echo.

It preserves trace without confusing persistence for truth.

Final runtime law:

Source remains source.
Ledger records continuity.
Runtime processes active structure.
Projection exposes bounded view.
Retention governs persistence.
Echo reintroduces retained trace.
Admissibility permits re-entry.
Proof tests survival.
Governance authorizes consequence.
Agency acts only through scoped authority.
